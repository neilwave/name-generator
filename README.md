# name-generator
Random name generator (HTML, CSS, JS)


**Function:**
Click a botton and reveal your Jazz-band-member-name :musical_score:

*Just for fun - don't take it too serious*

-----
To get random names the name-generator uses the http://www.datamuse.com/api/. So any self-written arrays are not needed and with this API it's more likely a true random output)

-----

I created this generator during my first #100DaysOfCode challenge.

## Topics in this generator
 
- random names,
- color shaker (random colors)
- API handling
